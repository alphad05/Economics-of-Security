The final draft report sections before Evaluation consisting of: Introduction, What security issue does the data speak to?, What would be the ideal metrics for security decision makers?, What are the metrics that exist in practice? and A definition of the metrics you can design from the dataset. The part of Evaluation for the first and second metric. It's worth to mention that although I wrote these sections Figure 1 and Figure 2 were produced by Turgce.
